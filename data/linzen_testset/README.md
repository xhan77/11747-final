The data from Linzen et al. are separated into several line-aligned files, similarly to the data in `agreement` folder:

- `subj_agr_filtered.text` contains the sentences;
- `subj_agr_filtered.gold` contains 4 tab-delimited columns: index to position of target in sentence; correct target form; wrong target form; number of attractors.
- `subj_agr_filtered.eval` contains the indices only
